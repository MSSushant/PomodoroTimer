# PomodoroTimer

I developed a Pomodoro Timer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which is a productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique. This technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Firstly, I structured the HTML to create the layout of the timer, which included a display for the countdown, buttons for starting, stopping, and resetting the timer, and an input field for users to adjust the work and break intervals if they wished.

For the visual aspect, I styled the application with CSS, giving it a clean and minimalistic look, with bold colors to differentiate between work and break periods. I used animations to make the transitions smooth and engaging.

The core functionality was implemented in JavaScript. I wrote functions to start the countdown, pause it, and reset the timer. I also ensured that the user could set custom durations for both the work and break periods. I used `setInterval` and `clearInterval` for handling the countdown timer, and DOM manipulation to update the display in real-time.

I also added audio notifications to alert the user when a session ends, making it convenient for them to know when to take a break or resume work without constantly checking the timer. Overall, this project sharpened my skills in front-end development and deepened my understanding of JavaScript's time-related functions.
